\begin{lemma}[3.2.vi]
	Prove that the limit of any small functor $F: C \rightarrow \bold{Set}$ is
	isomorphic to the set of functors $C \rightarrow \int F$ that defines a
	section to the canonical projection $ \prod : \int F \rightarrow C$ from the
	category of elements of $F$. Using this description of the limit, define the
	limit cone.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Since the category $\bold{Set}$ is complete, every diagram $F$ has limits
	valued in $C$. Thus we want to show that this set of limits is isomorphic to
	the set of functors $C \rightarrow \int F$.

	Let $\{ \phi\} _{i \in obC}$ be the set of functors $C \rightarrow \int F$,
	which defines a setion to $ \prod : \int F \rightarrow C$, such that, for
	$C\rightarrow^{\phi_i}\int F \rightarrow^{\prod} C$, $\prod \phi_i = 1_C$
	for all $i \in obC$, where $\prod$ is the forgetful functor. So $\prod
	\phi_i$ takes objects in $C$ to objects in $C$, forgeting covariance built
	into the category of elements along the way.

	Define a function $f: x \rightarrow y$, for $x \in \{ \phi\} _{i \in obC}
	$and $y \in limF$.
\end{proof}
