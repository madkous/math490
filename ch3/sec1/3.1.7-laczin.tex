\begin{exercise}
	Prove that if
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
			P \ar[r, "k"] \ar[d, "h"]
			\ar[dr, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start] & C\ar[d, "g"] \\
			B \ar[r, rightarrowtail, "f"] & A
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	is a pullback square and $f$ is a monomorphism, then $k$ is a monomorphism.
\end{exercise}
(Recall: the notation $\rightarrowtail$ means that $f$ is mono.)
\begin{proof}
	Consider morphisms $\func{l,e}{D}{P}$ where $ke=kl$ and $P$ is the pullback
	cone. We have that $gkl = gke$, which due to the commutativity of the diagram
	is the same as $fhl = fhe$, but since $f$ is mono, $hl=he$. Letting
	$c=kl=ke$ and $b=hl=he$, we have the following diagram.
	\[\xymatrix{
		D\ar@/_/[ddr]_b \ar@/^/[drr]^c\ar[dr]|d\\
		&P\ar[r]^k\ar[d]_h\ar[dr] & C\ar[d]^g \\
		&B\ \ar@{>->}[r]_f & A
	}\]
	Then we have that $gc=fb$ and there must be a unique morphism $d$ where
	$c=kd$ and $b=hd$. Since $d$ is unique, we must have that $l=e$ and thus $k$
	is a monomorphism.
\end{proof}
