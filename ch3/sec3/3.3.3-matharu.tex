	Prove Lemma 3.3.6, that an equivalence of categories, reflects and creates
	any limits and colimits that are present in either its domain or codomain.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
	If two categories $ \sC\AND \sD $ are equivalent, then there is a full
	faithful and essentially surjective functor $ \func{F}{\sC}{\sD}. $ By the
	previous question $ F $ reflects limits. Let $ G $ be cone over a diagram
	$ H\colon \sJ\to\sC $ with apex $ c $ in $ \sC.$ We need to show that
	$ FG $ is a cone in $ \sD.$
	Since $ G $ is a cone we have the following commutative triangle
	$$
	\xymatrix{&c\ar[dr]^{\lm_j}\ar[dl]_{\lm_k}\\Hj\ar[rr]_{Hf}&&Hk
	}
	$$
	where $ (\func{\lm_j}{c}{Hj} )_{j\in\ob\sJ}$ and $ \func{f}{j}{k} $ is a
	morphism in $ \sJ. $ Since $ F $ is faithful, $ F $ uniquely maps
	$ f\IN\mor\sJ\AND \lm_j $ to $ Ff\AND F\lm_j,$ respectively. Since $ G $ is a cone in $
	\sC $ and $ F $ respects composition we know that the following diagram
	commutes.
	$$
	\xymatrix{&Fc\ar[dr]^{F\lm_j}\ar[dl]_{F\lm_k}\\FHj\ar[rr]_{FHf}&&FHk
	}
	$$
	Thus $ F $ preserves cones, and therefore preserves limits.  Because $ F $
	is full and faithful, by exercise 1.5.iv $ F $ reflects isomorphisms. This
	fulfills the criteria to apply the next question 3.3.iv,
	so $ F $ creates limits. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
