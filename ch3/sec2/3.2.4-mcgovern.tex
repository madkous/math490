\begin{exercise}
 Generalize Exercise 3.2.iii to show that for any small category $\sJ$, any
 locally small category $\sC$ and any paralell pair of functors $F,G\colon \sJ
 \rightarrow \sC$, the set $\Hom(F,G)$ of natural transformations can be defined
 as a small limit in $\Set$. (Hint: the diagram whose limit is $\Hom(F,G)$ is
 indexed by a category $\sJ^{\S}$ whose objects are morphisms in $\sJ$ and which
 had morphisms $1_x \rightarrow f$, $1_y \rightarrow f$ for every $f\colon
 x\rightarrow y$ in $\sJ$)
 \end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
First, we note that the underlying shape of the diagram in $\Set$ will be based on the following diagram in $\sJ^{\S}$:
\begin{align}
    \xymatrix{
    1_{x} \ar[r] & f & \ar[l] 1_y}
\end{align}
Now, we define a functor $H\colon \sJ^{\S} \rightarrow \sC$ as the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For $f \in ob\sJ^{\S}$ where $f\colon x \rightarrow y$, $Hf = \sC(Fx,Gy)$
    \item For a morphism $\tau\colon 1_x \rightarrow f$ in $J{\S}$ where $f\colon
	    \rightarrow y$, $H\tau\colon \sC(Fx,Gx) \rightarrow C(Fx, Gy)$ is defined
	    as  post-compostion by $Gf$ and if $\tau: 1_y \rightarrow f$,
	    $H\tau\colon \sC(Fy,Gy) \rightarrow \sC(Fx,Gy)$ is defined as precomposition
	    by $Gf$.
\end{itemize}
We see that the image of $(1)$ under this functor is :
\begin{align}
    \xymatrix{
    \sC(Fx,Gx) \ar[r]^{Gf \circ -} & \sC(Fx, Gy)  &\ar[l]^{- \circ Ff} \sC(Fy, Gy)
    }
\end{align}

Now, we must show that $\Hom(F,G)$ is a cone over this diagram. To do this, we
construct a family of functions $\phi_{xy}\colon \Hom(F,G) \rightarrow \sC(Fx,Gy)$
where $\phi_{xy}(\eta) = \eta_x$, the corresponding component of the natural
transformation (if this is the case, we denote it as $\phi_{x}$ if $x = y$ and
$\phi_{xy}(\eta) = Gf\eta_x$ if $x \neq y$. Because we have that $\eta$ is a
natural transformation and that $Gf\eta_x = \eta_yFf$, we see that we have
commutativity of:

\begin{align}
   \xymatrix
   { & \Hom(F,G) \ar[dl]_{\phi_x} \ar[dr]^{\phi_y} \ar[d]_{\phi_{xy}}  & \\
     \sC(Fx,Gx) \ar[r]^{Gf \circ -} & \sC(Fx, Gy)  &\ar[l]^{- \circ Ff} \sC(Fy, Gy)
   }
\end{align}

Now, we must show that $\Hom(F,G)$ is the limit for this diagram. Suppose that
there is an object $X \in \Set$ that also forms a cone over our diagram. This
means that for every object $f \in \sJ^{\S}$ and $Hf = \sC(Fx, Gy)$, we have a
$\sigma_{x,y}\colon X \rightarrow \sC(Fx,Gy)$ so that $\sigma_{xy}(k)\colon Fx \rightarrow
Gy$ and in particular, if $x=y$, then $\sigma_{x}(k)\colon Fx \rightarrow Gx$. Now,
suppose we have a $r: X \rightarrow \Hom(F,G)$, such that $\sigma_{x} =
\phi_{x}r$. So for $k \in X$ $\phi_{x}r(k)  = \sigma_{x}(k)$. Now, consider
that $\phi_x$ is selecting the $x$ component of the natural transformation
$r(k)$, so $(r(k))_x = \sigma_{x}(k)$. So, we see what the construction of $r$
must be. This is the only possible construction that satisfies $\phi_{x}r =
\sigma_x$. We can also easily see that $\phi_{xy}r = \sigma_{xy}$ with our
construction of $r$. So we have shown that any cone with apex $X$ factors
uniquely through $\Hom(F,G)$ and so $\Hom(F,G)$ is the limit of this diagram.

\end{proof}
