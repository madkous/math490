	Show that any two terminal objects in a category are connected by a unique
	isomorphism.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Let $t_0$ and $t_1$ be two terminal objects in a category $f\colon X \rightarrow Y$.
That means there is a unique homomorphism $f_0\colon x \rightarrow t_0$ and $f_1\colon x
\rightarrow t_1$ for all $x$ in $X$. We want to show that there is a unique
isomorphism between $t_0$ and $t_1$.
%Before we show that there is a unique isomorphism, let us first see if there is
%a homomorphism at all between the two terminal objects.
%Immediately we get the feeling that these are in fact the same object. Here's
%how.
Since $t_0$ is a terminal object, we have a morphism $f_0\colon t_1 \rightarrow t_0$.
And since $t_1$ is a terminal object, we have a morphism $f_1\colon t_0 \rightarrow
t_1$. Consider the composition $f_0 f_1$. This gives us $f_0 f_1\colon t_0
\rightarrow t_1 \rightarrow t_0$ or more simply $f_0 f_1\colon t_0 \rightarrow t_0$.
So we must have that $f_0 f_1 = 1_{t_0}$. Similarly, it must be that $f_1 f_0 =
1_{t_1}$. This is exactly what it means to be isomorphic.
Therefore any two terminal objects in a category are indeed connected by a
unique isomorphism.
%Since $t_0 \in X$ is a terminal object, anything else in $X$ maps to $t_0$,
%including $t_1$. So we have $f_0\colon t_1 \rightarrow t_0$.
\end{proof}
