\begin{exercise}
	Find a concrete category that contains a monomorphism whose underlying
	function is not injective. Find a concrete category that contains an
	epimorphism whose underlying function is not surjective.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	For the first example, take a subcategory of $\Set$, $\sC$, consisting
	of two objects, $A$ being the set with elements 0, 1, and 2, and $B$ being
	the set with elements 0, and 1. Take as morphisms between $A$ and $B$ the
	identity morphisms, $1_A$ and $1_B$, along with the morphism, $f \colon A
	\rightarrow B$, defined by $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 0$, and $f(2) = 0$. Since
	$fg= fh$ implies $g=h=1_A$, then $f$ is a monomorphism. Yet since $f$
	sends $0$ to $0$ and $1$ to $0$ in the underlying sets, then $f$is not
	injective.

	For the second example, take the objects $\ZZ$ and $\QQ$ in the
	category $\Ring$. There is a unique ring homomorphism between $\ZZ$ and $\QQ$. This homomorphism is not surjective on the underlying sets,
	yet from the previous exercise 1.2.v, this homomorphism is an epimorphism.
\end{proof}
