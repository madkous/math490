For any group $G$, we may define other groups:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{center} $Z(G) = \{h \in G \mid hg = gh\ \forall g\in G\}$
	\item the \textbf{commutator subgroup} $C(G)$, the subgroup generated by the
		element $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ for any $g,h \in G$, and
	\item the \textbf{automorphism group} $ \Aut(G), $ the group of isomorphisms
		$\phi\colon G \rightarrow G$ in $\Group$.
\end{itemize}
Trivially, all three constructions define a functor from the discrete category of groups (with only indentity morphsims) to \Group. Are these constructions functorial in
\begin{itemize}
	\item the isomorphisms of groups? That is, do they extend to functors
		$\Group_{\iso} \rightarrow \Group$?
	\item the epimorphisms of groups? That is, do they extend to functors
		$\Group_{\epi} \rightarrow \Group$?
	\item the homomorphisms of groups? That is, do they extend to functors
		$\Group \rightarrow \Group$?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}

First, consider the functor $F_Z\colon \Group_{\ID}\rightarrow \Group$, where $G \rightarrow Z(G)$. We will now show that there exists a similar functor $F_Z\colon \Group_{\epi} \rightarrow \Group$. We define $F_Z$ as the following: $F_Z(G) = Z(G)$ and if $f\colon G \rightarrow H$, then $F_{Z} f = f|_{Z(G)}$. We must show that this functor satisfies the properties of a functor.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Because each group has a unique center and each morphism $f$ with
		$\dom(f) = G$ has a unique restriction to $Z(G)$, this functor is well
		defined and satisfies the first two properties (0 and 1).
	\item We see that $F_{Z} 1_{G} = 1_{G}|_{Z(G)} = 1_{Z(G)} = 1_{F_{Z}G}$, so
		the functor preserves identities.
	\item We easily see that by definition of function restriction, if $f\colon
		G \rightarrow H$, then $\dom(F_{Z}f) = F_{Z}\dom(f)$. We choose
		$\cod(F_{Z}f) = Z(H) = F_Z(\cod(f))$. To see that our morphisms are
		still well-defined from when the domain and codomain are restricted by
		this functor, we show that if $g \in Z(G)$, then $f(g) \in Z(H)$. To do
		this, consider, for any $k \in H$, that since $f$ is an epimorphism and
		therefore surjective, that $k = f(h)$ for some $h \in G$, so
		\[f(g)k = f(g)f(h) = f(gh).\] Since $g \in Z(G)$,
		\[f(gh) = f(hg) = f(h)f(g) = kf(g)\]
		So $f(g) \in Z(H)$ and therefore we have a well-defined morphism
		from $F_ZG$ to $F_ZH$.
	\item If $f\colon G \rightarrow H$ and $g\colon H \rightarrow K$, we see
		that $F_Z(gf) = gf|_{Z(G)}$. By the property we proved in the previous
		part \[gf|_{Z(G)} = g|_{Z(H)}f|_{Z(G)} = F_ZgF_Zf.\] So this functor
		also preserves morphism composition.
\end{enumerate}

We have seen that $F_Z$ satisfies all properties of a functor. We also note that
$F_Z$ will be a functor from $\Group_{\iso} \rightarrow \Group$.

To show that there is no such functor between $\Group$ and $\Group$, consider the
composition of the homomorphism $\sgn\colon S_n \rightarrow \{ \pm 1 \} $ and
$\iota\colon \{1, (1 \,\, 2) \} \rightarrow S_4$. We say $ g(x) =
\sgn(\iota(x))$. We see that $g$ is an isomorphism, and so $F_Zg$ should also be
an isomorphism. However, this is not possible under any function of morphism, as
$S_4$ has a trivial center and so any morphism from $Z(\{1, (1\,\,2)\}
\rightarrow Z(S_4) \rightarrow Z(\{\pm 1\})$ must be trivial. So $F_Z$ cannot be
a functor from $\Group \rightarrow \Group$.

Now consider the functor $F_C\colon  \Group_{\ID} \rightarrow \Group$. We will
show there exists a similarly constructed functor from $\Group \rightarrow
\Group$ defined as the following: for $G \in \ob(\Group)$, $F_CG = C(G)$, where
$ C(G) $ is the commutator subgroup of $G$. If $f \colon G \rightarrow H$, $F_Cf
= f|_{C(G)}$, We will show that this satisfies all the properties of a functor.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Because each group has a unique commutator subgroup and each morphism
		$f$ with $\dom(f) = G$ has a unique restriction to $C(G)$, this functor
		is well defined and satisfies the first two properties (0 and 1).
	\item We see that $F_{C} 1_{G} = 1_{G}|_{C(G)} = 1_{C(G)} = 1_{F_{C}G}$, so
		the functor preserves identities.
	\item We easily see that by definition of function restriction, if $f\colon
		G \rightarrow H$, then $\dom(F_{Z}f) = F_{Z}\dom(f)$. We choose
		$\cod(F_{C}f) = C(H) = F_C(\cod(f))$. To see that our morphisms are well
		defined when we restrict the domain and codomain, we show that if $g \in
		C(G)$, then $f(g) \in C(H)$. If $g \in C(G)$, $g = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} a_i$,
		where each $a_i = hkh^{-1}k^{-1}$ for some $h,k \in G$. So
		\begin{align*}
			f(g) &= f\qty{\prod_{i = 1}^{n} h_ik_ih_i^{-1}k_i^{-1}} \\ &=
			\prod_{i = 1}^{n} f\qty{h_ik_ih_i^{-1}k_i^{-1}} \\ &=
			\prod_{i = 1}^{n} f(h_i)f(k_i)f\qty{h_i^{-1}}f\qty{k_i^{-1}} \\ &=
			\prod_{i = 1}^{n} f(h_i)f(k_i)f(h_i)^{-1}f(k_i)^{-1}
		\end{align*}
		But since $f(k_i), f(h_i) \in H$,
		this is an element of $C(H)$. So if $g \in C(G)$, $f(G) \in C(H)$ and
		therefore we have well-defined morphisms from our restricted domain to
		our restricted co-domain.
	\item If $f\colon G \rightarrow H$ and $g\colon H \rightarrow K$, we see
		that $F_C(gf) = gf|_{C(G)}$. By the property we proved in the previous
		part \[gf|_{C(G)} = g|_{C(H)}f|_{C(G)} = F_CgF_Cf.\] So this functor
		also preserves morphism composition.
\end{enumerate}

So we have shown that this is a functor for $\Group \rightarrow \Group$, and we
note that this implies that it is also a functor for $\Group_{\iso} \rightarrow
\Group$ and $\Group_{\epi} \rightarrow \Group$.

Next, we show that there is a functor $F_A\colon \Group_{\iso} \rightarrow
\Group$, defined as follows: If $G$ is a group, then $F_AG = \Aut(G)$ and if
$\phi$ is a morphism between two groups $G$ and $H$, then $(F_A\phi)(f) = \phi f
\phi^{-1}$. We now show that this definition satisfies the properties of a
functor.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each group has uniquely defined automorphism group, and each morphism $\phi$ conjugates elements of $\Aut(G)$in a unique way, so the functor is well defined.
	\item $F_A(1_G)(f) = 1f1 = 1_{\Aut(G)}(f)$, so the functor preserves identities.
	\item $F_A(\dom \phi) = F_A(G) = \Aut(G) = \dom F_A(\phi)$.
	\item By definiton of $F_A$, $\cod(F_A\phi) = \Aut(H) = F_A(\cod(\phi))$.We see that $\phi f \phi^{-1} \in \Aut(H)$ for any $f \in \Aut(G)$ because it is a compostition of ismorphisms and therefore also an isomorphism. So when we restrict the domain and codomain of our morphisms using this functor, then they are still well-defined.
	\item For two composable morphisms $\phi$ and $\tau$, \[F_A(\phi\tau)(f) = \phi\tau f (\phi\tau)^{-1} = \phi \tau f \tau^{-1} \phi^{-1} = F_A(\phi)(\tau f \tau^{-1}) = F_A(\phi)F_A(\tau)(f),\] so this functor preserves composition.

\end{enumerate}
So $F_A$ satisfies all the properties of a functor, and there exists a functor from $\Group_{\iso} \rightarrow \Group$ of the desired form.

It is unclear whether or not there is a functor from  $\Group_{\epi}$ to $\Group$ and from $\Group$ to $\Group$ defined in the manner, but I believe that this is not the case, although I am having trouble finding a counterexample.
\end{proof}
