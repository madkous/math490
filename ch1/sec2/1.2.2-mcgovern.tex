	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item Show that a morphism \( \func{f}{x}{y} \) is a split epimorphism
		in a category \( \sC \) if and only if for all \( c\in \sC,\)
		post-composition \( \func{f_*}{\sC(c,x)}{\sC(c,y)} \) defines a
		surjective function.
	\begin{proof}
		 First, assume that \(f\) is a split epimorphism and that \(c \in
		 \ob\sC\). That is, there exists a function \(\func{g}{y}{x}\) such that
		 \(fg = \id_y\). Now, consider the function
		 \(\func{f_*}{\sC(c,x)}{\sC(c,y)}.\) We know that this function
		 corresponds to composition on the left by \(f\), so in order for this
		 function to be surjective, for every \(\func{k}{c}{y}\), there must
		 exists a \(\func{j}{c}{x}\) such that \(fj = k\). Now, for an arbitrary
		 \(k\), consider \(j = gk\). It is easy to see that \(\func{gk}{c}{x}\),
		 and that \(f_*(gk) = f(gk) = (fg)k = \id_yk = k\). Since we can construct
		 \(j\) in this way for every \(k \in \sC(c,y)\), we see that \(f_*\)
		 is surjective.

		Now, assume that \(f_*\) is surjective, that is, for any choice of \(c
		\in \sC\),  and any \(k \in \sC(c,y)\), \(k = fg\), for some \(g \in
		\sC(c,x)\). Now, suppose \(c = y\) and \(k = \id_y\), so we have that
		there exists a \(g \in \sC(y,x)\) where \(fg = \id_y\), and this implies
		that \(f\) is a spilt epimorphism.
	\end{proof}

	\item Argue by duality that \(f\) is a split monomoprhism if and
		only if for all \(c\in\sC,\) pre-composition
		\(\func{f^*}{\sC(y,c)}{\sC(x,c)}\) is a surjective function.
	\begin{proof}
		We know that if \(f^{\op}\) is a split epimorphism, that
		\(\func{f_{*}^{\op}}{C^{\op}(c,y)}{C^{\op}(c,x)}\) is surjective.
		However, if we consider the definitions of \(f^{\op}\) and split
		monomorphisms and epimorphisms, we see that \(f^{\op}\) being a split
		epimorphism implies that \(f\) is a split monomorphism. We also see that
		\(\func{f_{*}^{\op}}{\sC^{\op}(c,y)}{\sC^{\op}(c,x)}\) is equivalent to
		\(\func{f^{*}}{\sC(y,c)}{\sC(x,c)}.\) So we have that \(f\) is a split
		monomorphism if and only if \(\func{f^{*}}{\sC(y,c)}{\sC(x,c)}\) is
		surjective.
	\end{proof}
