		\(\pfunc{h,k}{w}{x}\), \(fh=fk\) implies that \(h=k\); or

\begin{exercise}
	What are the monomorphisms in the category of fields?
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
In the category of fields, morphisms are field homomorphisms. Let
\(\func{f}{A}{B}\) be a morphism in \Field. As \(f\) is a field homomorphism,
its kernel is an ideal in \(B\). Since \(B\) is a field, there are only two
ideals: \(\{0\}\) and \(B\) itself. The kernel of \(f\) cannot be the whole
field, since this would be the zero morphism which is not a field homomorphism.
So \(\ker f = \{0\}\) and from this, \(f\) is injective, and in particular it is
left cancellable.

Let \(h\) and \(k\) be morphisms in \Field for which composition with \(f\)
makes sense and say that \[fh = fk.\] Since \(f\) is left cancellable, this
implies that \[h = k,\] and \(f\) is a monomorphism by Definition 1.2.7(i) above.
(In fact, injections are monomorphisms in any category in which the objects have
``underlying sets''.)

Thus, all of the morphisms in \Field are monomorphisms.
\end{proof}
