\begin{exercise}
	Prove that if $\cat{C}$ is small and $\cat{D}$ is locally small, then
	$\cat{D}^\cat{C}$ is locally small by defining a monomorphism from the
	collection of natural transformations between a fixed pair of functors
	$\pfunc{F,G}{\cat{C}}{\cat{D}}$ into a set. (Hint: Think about the function
	that sends a natural transformation to its collection of components.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\func{\gamma}{\text{Nat}(F,G)}{\Set}$, given by
	$\alpha\mapsto\{\alpha_c\in\mor\cat{D}\}$ where
	$\Func{\alpha}{F}{G}\in\text{Nat}(F,G)$. We must show that
	$\{\alpha_c\in\mor\cat{D}\}$ is a set. We can do this by noting that since
	$\cat{D}$ is locally small, $\cat{D}(x,y)$ is a set for all choices of
	$x,y$. Let $\func{\delta}{\ob\cat{C}}{\mathcal{P}(\mor\cat{D})}$, given by
	$c\mapsto\cat{D}(Fc,Gc)$, where $\mathcal{P}(\mor\cat{D})$ is the power
	class of $\mor\cat{D}$. We know that
	$\cat{D}(Fc,Gc)\in\mathcal{P}(\mor\cat{D})$, and since $\ob\cat{C}$ is a
	set, the range of $\delta$ is a set by the Axiom of Replacement. Taking the
	union of the range of $\delta$, which is also a set, gives us a set that
	contains all of the possible natural transformations from $F$ to $G$.

	So $\gamma$ sends any natural transformation to an element of this new set.
	Since the class of functions between pairs of sets is a set, and that the
	class of natural transformations between $F$ and $G$ is a subclass of this
	set, we have that these transformations form a set by restricted
	comprehension. Then, $\cat{D}^\cat{C}$ is locally small.
\end{proof}
