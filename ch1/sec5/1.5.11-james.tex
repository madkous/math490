\subparagraph{\(\Ring\to\Rng\)}
\begin{proof}
	Before defining the functor $\Ring\rightarrow \Rng$, first the category \Rng 
	needs some description. Since a rng, denoted here by $R^-$, is a non-unital 
	ring, we note that $(R^-,+)$ is a commutative group and $(R^-,*)$ is a magma 
	with associativity (or a monoid without the condition of identity). Thus every 
	ring, $R$, is a rng by the fact that $R$ is a monoid under multiplication, and 
	this monoid is certainly a magma with associativity. So the objects in the 
	category \Ring are included in the class of objects of \Rng. 

	Let the functor in question be the inclusion functor $\iota\colon \Ring\rightarrow \Rng$ that maps rings in \Ring to rings in \Rng, and ring homomorphispms in \Ring to rng homomorphisms between rings in \Rng. The rng homomorphisms have all of the properties of ring homomorphisms, except the condition of mapping units in one rng to units in another. 

	To test whether $\iota$ is a full functor, take $\mathbf{0}$ and  $\QQ$ in 
	Ring. Then $\iota \mathbf{0}, \iota \QQ$ are rings included in \Rng, and hence 
	are the same $\mathbf{0}$ and  $\QQ$. Since there exists a rng homomorphism 
	$\phi$ between $\mathbf{0}$ and $\QQ$, i.e., the homomorphism that maps $0$ to 
	$0$,while there is no ring homomorphisms between the same two objects in $\Ring$, then $\phi$ is not mapped to by $\iota$ acting on any ring 
	homomorphism in $\Ring$.  Thus, $\iota$ is not surjective between the 
	morphisms fixed on any two objects in \Ring. Hence $\iota$ is not full.

	To test whether $\iota$ is faithful, for the objects $c \not= c'$ in Ring, take 
	two homomorphisms $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ in Ring between $c, c'$. Applying 
	$\iota$ to $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ yields $\iota \phi_1$ and $\iota \phi_2$, 
	which remain unequal when applied to the objects $\iota c = c$ and $\iota c' = 
	c'$. Thus $\iota$ is injective on morphisms between fixed objects in Ring. Thus 
	$\iota$ is faithful.

	To test whether $\iota$ is essentially surjective, we can take the object in 
	$\Rng$, $E$ of even integers. Since $1 \notin E$, then $E$ is not 
	isomorphic to any ring that is also in $\Rng$. Thus $\iota$ is not 
	essentially surjective.

	From the theorem characterizing the equivalence of categories, since $\iota$ fails to be a full functor from \Ring to \Rng, then there is not an equivalence of categories between \Ring and \Rng.
