\begin{exercise}
	Show that a full and faithful functor \(\func{F}{\sC}{\sD}\) both
	\textbf{reflects} and \textbf{creates isomorphisms}. That is, show:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If \(f\) is a morphism in \(\sC\) so that \(Ff\) is an isomorphism
			in \(\sD\), then \(f\) is an isomorphism.

		\item If \(x\) and \(y\) are objects in \(\sC\) so that \(Fx\) and
			\(Fy\) are isomorphic in \(\sD\), then \(x\) and \(y\) are
			isomorphic in \(\sC\).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
	Consider categories $\sC$ and $\sD$, and a functor $F\colon \sC \rightarrow \sD$ that is
	full and faithful. That is, for all $x,y \in \sC$, the function $F\colon \sC(x,y)
	\rightarrow \sD(Fx,Fy)$ that takes $f$ to $Ff$ is bijective. Now, for a
	morphism $f\colon x\rightarrow y$, suppose that $Ff\colon Fx \rightarrow Fy$ is an
	isomorphism. This means that there exists $G\colon Fy \rightarrow Fx$ where
	$G(Ff) = \id_{Fx}$ and $Ff(G) = \id_{Fy}$. Now, we can apply the definition of
	full and faithful functor to see that $\sC(y,x)$ is in bijection with
	$\sD(Fy,Fx)$ and so there exists a unique $g \in \sC(y,x)$ where $Fg = G$. We
	claim that $g = f^{-1}$.

	To show this, we must show that $fg = \id_y$. We consider $F(fg)$, the image
	of $fg$ under our full and faithful functor. We see that
	$$ F(fg) = FfFg = FfG = \id_{Fy} = F(\id_y)$$
	by properties of functors and our previous definitions of $g$ and $G$. Since
	we know that $F\colon \sC(y,y) \rightarrow \sD(Fy,F,y)$ is bijective, $F(fg) =
	F(\id_y)$ implies that $fg = \id_y$. We must also show that $gf = \id_x$. We
	use a similar method and show that
	$$F(gf) = FgFf = G(Ff) = \id_{Fx} = F(\id_x).$$
	Since we again know that $F\colon \sC(x,x) \rightarrow \sD(Fx,Fx)$ is bijective, this
	implies that $gf = \id_x$. So we have that $fg = \id_y$ and that $gf = \id_x$.
	Therefore, $f$ is an isomorphism with inverse $g$.

	\subparagraph{}
	If $Fx$ and $Fy$ are isomorphic, we know that there exists some isomorphism
	$G\colon Fx \rightarrow Fy$. But since $F$ is a full and faithful functor
	and therefore $\sC(x,y)$ is in bijection with $\sD(Fx,Fy)$, $G = Ff$ for
	some $f\colon x \rightarrow y$. By the previous part, we know that if $Ff$
	is an isomorphism, then $f$ is also an isomorphism, so we see here that we
	have an isomorphism $f\colon x \rightarrow y$, and therefore $x$ and $y$ are
	isomorphic.
\end{proof}
